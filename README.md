CSCA-5622 Supervised Machine Learning Final Project

This project aims to evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, when applied to time series data. By adapting supervised learning methods on the Uber fare dataset, this experimental analysis lays the foundation for understanding autoregression, a time series technique to be explored in future projects.
