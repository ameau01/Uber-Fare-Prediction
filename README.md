CSCA-5622 Supervised Machine Learning Final Project

The Spotify Tracks Dataset project aims to identify the audio features that characterize viral and popular songs by predicting Hit Songs (Top 1% Viral Songs and Top 10% Popular Songs) versus Non-Hit Songs. Using unsupervised methods like K-means and NMF clustering, as well as supervised learning with Random Forest, the project evaluates model performance through accuracy and precision, deriving a recipe for popular songs based on key features like "danceability", "loudness", and "acousticness."
